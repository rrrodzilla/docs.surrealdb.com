# `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE BEARER`

<Since v="v2.2.0" />

> [!CAUTION]
> Currently, the `BEARER` access method is an experimental feature intended to be used for validating its suitability and security. As such, it may be subject to breaking changes and may present unidentified security issues. Do not rely on this feature in production applications. To enable this and other experimental features related to bearer access, set the `SURREAL_EXPERIMENTAL_BEARER_ACCESS` environment variable to `true`.

A bearer access method allows generating bearer grants with an associated key that can be used to access SurrealDB as a specific [system user](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#system-users) or [record user](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users). Bearer grants allow other systems and software to authenticate with SurrealDB using a secure and unique credential that can be audited and revoked at any time.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a [root, namespace or database user](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) before you can define a record access method.

## Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE ACCESS [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
  ON DATABASE TYPE BEARER FOR [ USER | RECORD ]
  [ AUTHENTICATE @expression ]
  [ DURATION
    [ FOR GRANT @duration ]
    [ FOR TOKEN @duration ]
    [ FOR SESSION @duration ]
  ]
```

## Example usage

Below shows how you can define bearer access using the `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE BEARER` statement.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS account ON DATABASE TYPE USER DURATION FOR GRANT 30d, FOR TOKEN 15m, FOR SESSION 12h;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define an access method of type BEARER only if it does not already exist. You should use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when defining an access method in SurrealDB if you want to ensure that the access method is only created if it does not already exist. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will return an error.

It's particularly useful when you want to safely attempt to define an access method without manually checking its existence first.

```surql
-- Create a BEARER access method for the example database if it does not already exist
DEFINE ACCESS IF NOT EXISTS example ON DATABASE TYPE BEARER;
```

## Using `OVERWRITE` clause

The `OVERWRITE` clause can be used to define an access method of type BEARER and overwrite an existing one if it already exists. You should use the `OVERWRITE` clause when you want to modify an existing access method definition. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will overwrite the existing access method definition with the new one.

```surql
-- Create a BEARER access method for the example database and overwrite if it already exists
DEFINE ACCESS OVERWRITE example ON DATABASE TYPE BEARER;
```
